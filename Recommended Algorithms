Recommended Algorithms for This Use Case

1. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)

Examples: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

Why good: Captures complex feature interactions, handles non-linearity, good for tabular finance data.

Strengths: Works well with small-to-medium datasets, interpretable via SHAP values, easy to tune.

Use here: Classify options setups as “likely big move” vs “not likely” using features like OI change, IV rank, momentum, breakout patterns, sector strength.

2. Random Forest

Why: Similar to GBDT but less sensitive to overfitting; can work well if you have noisy features.

Use: As a baseline non-linear model before moving to boosting.

3. SVM (Support Vector Machine)

Why: Good when you have many features but fewer samples (e.g., monthly expiry prediction with years of data).

Caveat: Needs careful scaling and kernel selection; less interpretable.

4. Neural Networks (MLP / LSTM)

When to use: If you have a lot of sequential intraday data and want to capture temporal dependencies.

LSTM/GRU: Works well for time-series if you want to feed in sequences of OI/IV/price changes.

Caveat: More data-hungry, harder to explain; prone to overfitting on small datasets.
